# Test assignment

ABN AMRO Mobile QA Engineer Assignment done by Allaa Ismail
----------------------------------------

In this Repository, I tried to cover all the scenarios for testing the assignment's app.
Also, i used POM pattern as it reduces code duplication and improves test maintenance.

----------------------------------------
1. The `MainScreen.kt` class is for the functions that will be used to interact with the Main Screen.
2. The `Actions.kt` class is for the helper functions that will be used frequently.
3. The `MainScreenTest.kt` class is for the tests that covers all the app.

The classes can be found under _/app/src/androidTest/java/_
